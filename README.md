# Gator Course Advisor

## Project Description

Gator Course Advisor is an upcoming AI-powered course recommendation tool designed specifically for University of Florida students. This project aims to help students select courses based on data-driven insights, analyzing course information, prerequisites, and student feedback to provide personalized recommendations.

The project is currently in its early stages of development. Our goal is to create a comprehensive system that will assist UF students in making informed decisions about their academic journey through intelligent course recommendations.

## Getting Started â€“ Local Repository Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project locally, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Check your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- **Git**: Verify Git installation with `git --version`

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

#### For Both Windows and Mac:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishaan05desai/Gator-Course-Advisor.git
cd Gator-Course-Advisor
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On Mac/Linux:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The requirements.txt file and actual project dependencies may be added in future development phases as the project evolves.

### Step 4: Verify Setup

After completing the setup, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on the project:

```bash
deactivate
```
